# Bigger next goal: Implement optimal design calculation

# Smaller side goal: Figure how to use pseuso-log or broken axis in plotly (Likely much work and little benefit)

# Check plot_ly reference for ticks:
https://plotly.com/r/reference/#Layout_and_layout_style_objects

# Finalize plot.td2pLL function
	- model class might still be old one (ext3pLL), update to td2pLL
	- function description missing / updates
	- for xaxis_scla and y_axis_scale, consider this entry of plotly_reference:
		type 
			Parent: layout.scene.xaxis 
			Type: enumerated , one of ( "-" | "linear" | "log" | "date" | "category" ) 
			Default: "-" 
			Sets the axis type. By default, plotly attempts to determined the axis type
			by looking into the data of the traces that referenced the axis in question.
