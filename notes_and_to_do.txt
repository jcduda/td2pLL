TODOs for new aspect: Optimal design

-Maybe with Ludger: Try to improve algorithm using knowledge on optimal design structure
- Add a function that proposes discrete optimal design given n
- Function that makes optimal design for practice, i.e.: negative control per exposure maximal dose per exposure
- How to adapt the steepness parameter (allow decreasing steepnes with increasing exposure duration)?
