Description: This package offers functions to fit and plot a time-dose 
    two-parameter log-logistic (td2pLL) model to time-dose-response data with
    a special aim for cytotoxicity data. The model is an extended model of the
    famous two-parameter log-logistic (2pLL) model for dose-response data. The
    time component is integrated into the model via Haber's law. The 
    anova-td2pLL pipeline, where a pre-test for detecting possible influence
    of the (exposure) time on the dose-response curve is performed to
    conditionally calculate the td2pLL or a 2pLL model, is integrated, too.
    The package also helps with calculting and visualizing optimal experimental
    designs for (exposure) time-response experiments. See the work of Duda and
    RahnenfÃ¼hrer (2021) for details.
